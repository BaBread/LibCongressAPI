# Real Winners Quiz

## Key Concept

As a student, I often find myself frustrated with the current educational system that focuses more on earning points rather than ensuring I grasp the underlying concepts. This approach often leaves me memorizing information temporarily rather than truly understanding and retaining knowledge in the long term. To address this issue we are creating a test that tackles the ability of someone mastering a concept over relying on a pass/fail system. The test should be designed to evaluate the depth of knowledge and application of concepts, ensuring that students truly grasp the subject matter. It can consist of a combination of multiple-choice questions and true/false questions allowing students to demonstrate their comprehension and problem-solving skills.

## Challenges

The main obstacles we faced when it came to this project was in adopting and mastering a new css library that we have not used before. Probably the biggest challenge thus far, the API's. Finding and gaining access to the API's proved to be the most troublesome and it did not help that we initially wanted to use four API's. The biggest problem was to actually gain access to YouTube's API and with GitHub's API. With GitHub, the local key used to access the API keeps on getting revoked due to security measures and we have yet to learn how to use node.js.

## Contributions

We are thankful for having such a creative and hardworking team to bring this idea into reality.

Matthew Otabor, killing it with the html structure, functionality and Q & A's

Chrisly St Leger, creating something out of nothing with the css library Bulma, that was just introduced days ago

Cody Deering, bringing in one of the main API's with the code to impliment it

Kenneth Lau, working on our extra API and providing javascript code to impliment some extra fetures and functionality

Donald Leon, creating majority of the javascript code while providing our biggest key API and assisting the team with road blocks encountered
